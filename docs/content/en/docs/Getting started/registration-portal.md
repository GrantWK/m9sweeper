  Our registration portal walks you through installing m9sweeper. 
---

To make installing m9sweeper as easy as possible, we have created a registration portal that lets you
sign up your company to manage m9sweeper. 

It includes a wizard that walks you through installing m9sweeper end-to-end, letting you just fill in the blanks.

When you are done, it generates a helm install command for you, which could be used to install it using
our helm chart with a single command.
