  Installing the Webhook
---

In order to have m9sweeper enforce image scanning compliance in your cluster, you need to install a validating webhook
in your cluster. This should be done automatically by m9sweeper during the setup process, but if for some reason it
was not you can click "Update Kubeconfig" on your cluster's settings page and run through the setup wizard again
to have it install the webhook for you.
