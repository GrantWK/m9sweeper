  How to automatically scan your images. 
---

By default, m9sweeper will scan all images that it sees deployed in your cluster that have not been scanned. 

Also, you can configure the Image Rescan Period (Days) when setting up policies to automatically rescan images. This
will then rescan any images currently running in your cluster if they have not been scanned in a certain number of
days.
