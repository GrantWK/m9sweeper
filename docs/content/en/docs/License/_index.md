m9sweeper is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/). 


It was originally produced by [Intelletive Consulting](https://intelletive.com/), 
owned by 
[Jacob Beasley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobbeasley/) and 
[Jason Woodman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-woodman-8604476/). Once feature complete, we chose to open source 
instead of selling it as a licensed product because we saw a huge need for the product and were deeply passionate
about open source.

While the software is open source, but we do offer professional services for enterprises. This is ultimately how
we fund ongoing support and maintenance for the product. 
Please [contact us](https://m9sweeper.io/contact/) if you want information about a professional support contract. 
A support contract can include professional installation, support, monitoring, managed upgrades, and even coordinating
security fixes and remediation in your environment. We also are available, at times, to do Kubernetes DevOps
work. 

**We have released several open source products, including:**

- [m9sweeper](https://github.com/m9sweeper/m9sweeper)
- [m9sweeper helm charts](https://github.com/m9sweeper/charts)
- [kube-hunter easy install charts](https://github.com/m9sweeper/kube-hunter)
- [kube-bench easy install charts](https://github.com/m9sweeper/kube-bench)
- [k8-ez - secure one-file kubernetes deployments for your apps](https://github.com/m9sweeper/k8-ez)
